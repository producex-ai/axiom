- Records retention schedule maintained per Record Management Procedure

================================================================================
9. MONITORING PLAN
================================================================================
Activity: Master Document List accuracy verification
Frequency: Monthly
Responsible: Document Control Coordinator
Method: Random sample 10 documents; verify current revision at point of use
Record: Document Control Audit Log (Form DC-002)
Corrective Action: Replace incorrect version immediately; investigate root cause

Activity: External document currency review
Frequency: Annually (or per regulatory update alerts)
Responsible: Quality Manager
Method: Review external document sources; compare to facility copies
Record: External Document Review Log (Form DC-003)

================================================================================
10. VERIFICATION & VALIDATION ACTIVITIES
================================================================================
- Internal audit of document control annually per Internal Audit Schedule
- Management review of document control performance quarterly

- User interviews during audits to confirm awareness of current documents

================================================================================
11. CORRECTIVE & PREVENTIVE ACTION (CAPA) PROTOCOL
================================================================================
Trigger: Obsolete document found in use, incorrect revision at workstation, 
undocumented changes, missing external document update

Immediate Action: Remove obsolete document; replace with current version; 
brief affected personnel

Root Cause Analysis: Investigate why document control failed (distribution 
missed, lack of training, inadequate removal verification)

Corrective Action: Implement controls to prevent recurrence (enhanced distribution 
checklist, additional training, automated distribution system)

Preventive Action: Trend analysis of document control issues quarterly; 
identify systemic gaps

Verification: Follow-up audit within 30 days to confirm effectiveness

================================================================================
12. TRACEABILITY & RECALL ELEMENTS
================================================================================
Document revision history enables traceability of procedures in effect during 
product production. In recall scenarios, document version effective at time
