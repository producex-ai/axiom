- Evaluate device placement and effectiveness
- Review contractor service frequency and thoroughness

Corrective Actions:
- Repair exclusion failures immediately
- Enhance sanitation procedures
- Increase device density in high-risk areas
- Adjust service frequency if needed
- Retrain employees on pest prevention

Preventive Actions:
