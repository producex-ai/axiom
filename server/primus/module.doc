8. PROCEDURES

I'll start generating the detailed SOP procedures for Section 8 Part A. Here are the first few requirements:

5.04.01 - Product Flow and Segregation Controls

Requirement Description:

Primus GFS requires facilities to maintain proper product flow to prevent cross-contamination. Product handling areas must be designed and operated to ensure separation between raw and finished products, with clear segregation protocols in place.

Implementation Procedure:

The facility maintains strict product flow controls through physical barriers and operational procedures. Production areas are divided into zones (raw material, processing, and finished product) with designated pathways marked by yellow floor lines. Staff must follow one-way traffic patterns and use separate equipment for raw and finished product areas. Required materials include zone signage, color-coded equipment, and physical barriers where needed.

The Production Supervisor conducts flow pattern monitoring every 2 hours during operational shifts. Inspections occur facility-wide with focus on transition points between zones. The supervisor spends approximately 15 minutes per inspection round, documenting observations and any corrective actions needed. Additional checks occur during shift changes and when production lines are modified.

All observations are recorded on Form OPS-101 (Product Flow Monitoring Log). Required data points include: time of inspection, zones checked, employee compliance with flow patterns, equipment placement verification, and any violations observed. Records are maintained in the QA office for 2 years and reviewed weekly by the QA Manager.

Monitoring criteria includes: 100% compliance with designated flow patterns, zero instances of cross-zone equipment usage, and proper maintenance of physical barriers. Verification occurs through direct observation, review of security camera footage, and monthly facility flow audits. Any deviation requires immediate correction and documentation.

Corrective Actions:

- Immediate stop of affected operations if cross-contamination risk identified

- Incident documentation on Form CAPA-101

- Root cause analysis within 24 hours

- Staff retraining as needed

- Follow-up audit within 48 hours

5.04.02 - Hand Washing Facilities and Procedures

Requirement Description:

Adequate hand washing facilities must be provided and properly maintained. Facilities must be easily accessible with appropriate supplies and clear instructions for proper hand washing procedures.

Implementation Procedure:

Hand washing stations are equipped with hot and cold running water, liquid soap dispensers, paper towels, and hands-free waste containers. Each station displays bilingual hand washing instructions with pictorials. Required supplies include: antibacterial soap, paper towels, sanitizer (minimum 60% alcohol), and maintenance supplies. Stations include hands-free faucets and foot-operated doors where possible.

The Sanitation Lead inspects all hand washing stations three times daily (pre-shift, mid-shift, and end-of-shift) at all facility entry points and within production areas. Each inspection takes approximately 10 minutes per station. Temperature checks of water supply must be conducted (minimum 100°F required), and supply levels monitored.

Documentation occurs on Form SAN-102 (Hand Wash Station Monitoring Log). Required recording includes: inspection time, water temperature, supply levels, cleanliness status, and any maintenance needs. Records are maintained electronically in the Sanitation Department database and reviewed daily by the Sanitation Manager.

Acceptance criteria includes: water temperature 100-120°F, fully stocked supplies, functional equipment, and clean/sanitary conditions. Verification through visual inspection, temperature monitoring, and weekly ATP testing of surfaces. Compliance must be ≥98% at all times.

Corrective Actions:

- Immediate restocking of supplies if depleted

- Equipment repair within 2 hours if malfunction detected

- Documentation on Form CAPA-102

- Investigation of repeated issues

- Weekly verification of corrective actions

I'll start generating detailed procedures for Section 8 Part B. Here are the first few requirements:

5.04.10 - Protection of Exposed Product During Storage and Transportation

Requirement Description:

All exposed product must be protected during storage and transportation to prevent contamination. Products must be covered, protected from condensation, and stored off the floor to prevent contact with moisture or contaminants.

Implementation Procedure:

Step-by-step procedures include inspecting all storage areas daily for proper product protection, ensuring products are covered with food-grade materials, maintaining proper storage heights (minimum 6 inches off floor), and verifying protection from overhead condensation. Required materials include plastic pallet covers, food-grade tarps, dunnage, pallets, and moisture-resistant coverings.

The Warehouse Supervisor conducts inspections twice daily (6:00 AM and 2:00 PM) in all storage areas and loading docks. Additional checks occur during product movement or staging. Each inspection should take approximately 15 minutes per area. The supervisor must verify proper coverage, height requirements, and absence of condensation risks.

Documentation is recorded on Form WH-201 (Product Protection Checklist). Records must include date, time, inspector name, areas checked, conditions observed, and any corrective actions taken. Forms are maintained in the QA office for minimum 2 years. The QA Manager reviews records weekly and conducts monthly verification audits.

Monitoring criteria includes: 100% product coverage when required, minimum 6-inch floor clearance, zero evidence of water/condensation contact, intact protective materials. Visual inspections verify compliance. Temperature and humidity monitoring in storage areas ensures conditions don't promote condensation.

Corrective Actions:

- Immediately cover exposed product

- Move product to compliant storage location

- Inspect product for damage/contamination

- Document incident on Form CAPA-110

- Investigate root cause

- Retrain staff if procedural gaps identified

- Follow-up inspection within 24 hours

5.04.11 - Cleaning Equipment Storage

Requirement Description:

All cleaning equipment must be stored in designated areas separate from production and storage areas. Equipment must be organized, maintained clean, and stored in a manner that prevents contamination.

Implementation Procedure:

Cleaning equipment storage requires dedicated rooms or areas with proper ventilation, drainage, and organization systems. Equipment includes color-coded tools, cleaning chemicals, brushes, mops, buckets, and PPE. Storage areas must have appropriate shelving, hooks, and containment systems. All items must be labeled and stored off the floor.

The Sanitation Supervisor inspects storage areas daily at start of shift (5:00 AM) and end of shift (6:00 PM). Weekly deep cleaning occurs every Sunday. Storage areas are locked with restricted access. Each inspection includes checking organization, cleanliness, proper storage, and inventory of supplies.

Form SAN-301 (Cleaning Equipment Storage Log) documents daily inspections. Required information includes equipment condition, chemical inventory, storage compliance, cleanliness rating, and inspector verification. Records maintained in Sanitation office for 2 years. Monthly audits by QA Manager verify compliance.

Storage requirements include: All equipment clean and dry before storage, chemicals in secondary containment, proper separation of tools by zone/area, no signs of pest activity, proper ventilation maintained. Weekly ATP testing of cleaned equipment, monthly environmental monitoring of storage areas.

Corrective Actions:

- Remove/clean any soiled equipment
