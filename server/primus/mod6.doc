         6.02.02
Have CCP decisions been made with logical, documented justification and where CCPs are implemented in a specific processing step, have they been developed to control the identified hazard(s)?
This question must be scored.
Scoring N/A is not allowed.
15
         6.02.03
Is the HACCP system reviewed when significant changes are made and at least once every 12 months?
10
         6.02.04
Have critical control point (CCP) processing steps been identified that eliminate or reduce food safety hazards to an acceptable level?
Information gathering. If the answer is YES, continue with the next question. If the answer is NO, the rest of “Module 6 HACCP” is not applicable.
Where the auditor finds error(s) in the logic applied, e.g., a step meets the requirements for a CCP, but it is not identified as such, the issue should be detailed here, and the rest of Module 6 is applicable and should be scored.
  Have CCP critical control limits been established and are they supported by relevant validation documentation?

         6.02.06
Have monitoring requirements and frequencies been determined and documented for the CCPs?

         6.02.07
Have specific responsibilities been assigned for the monitoring, recording and corrective action implementation of each CCP?

    Where laws, commodity specific guidelines and/or best practice recommendations exist and are derived from a reputable source, then these practices and parameters should be used. Audit users should allow a degree of risk association if laws, guidelines, best practices, etc., have not been documented.
