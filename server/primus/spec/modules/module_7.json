This module addresses team formation, hazard analysis, preventive controls, monitoring procedures, validation, verification, corrective actions, and re-analysis requirements.",
  "scope": "This module applies to both domestic (U.S.) and foreign food facilities (outside the U.S.) that are required to register under Section 415 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and comply with the Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food requirements mandated by the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). Auditees have the option to present combined HACCP and Preventive Control Systems, but auditors must report/score separately.",
