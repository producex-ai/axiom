    "All chemicals including pesticides, sanitizers, detergents, and lubricants must be stored securely in designated areas with proper labeling indicating contents, hazards, and usage instructions",
    "Food grade chemicals must be clearly separated from non-food grade chemicals to prevent cross-contamination and used only according to manufacturer label instructions",
    "Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) signage must be prominently displayed in appropriate areas throughout the facility to remind workers of hygiene and safety requirements",
    "Food defense controls must be implemented to prevent intentional contamination or adulteration of food products through access control, visitor management, and security measures",
    "Chemical storage areas must be designed to contain spills and leaks with adequate ventilation and emergency response equipment readily available",
    "All chemical containers must maintain original labels or have equivalent labeling that includes Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and usage concentrations",
    "Facility management must conduct regular inspections of chemical storage areas to verify compliance with safety and segregation requirements",
    "Food defense vulnerability assessments must be conducted and documented with corrective actions implemented for identified weaknesses"

  "capaInject": [
    "Establish a comprehensive chemical inventory management system with designated storage locations, labeling requirements, and regular inspection schedules",
    "Implement a chemical segregation procedure that physically separates food grade from non-food grade chemicals using locked cabinets, separate rooms, or clearly marked zones",
    "Develop and post GMP reminder signs at critical control points including entry areas, handwashing stations, toilet facilities, and production zones with multilingual content as needed",
    "Create a food defense plan that includes access control procedures, visitor sign-in requirements, security camera coverage, and employee background check policies",
    "When chemical labeling violations are found, immediately remove mislabeled or unlabeled chemicals from use, properly label or dispose of them, and retrain personnel on chemical handling procedures",
    "If food grade and non-food grade chemicals are found commingled, immediately segregate them, assess risk of contamination, and implement physical barriers to prevent future occurrences",
    "Establish a preventive maintenance schedule for GMP signage to replace faded, damaged, or missing signs and verify visibility and comprehension during worker training sessions",
    "Conduct annual food defense vulnerability assessments and update security measures based on findings, regulatory changes, and industry best practices"

    "Keep records of GMP signage installation and maintenance including sign location, language(s), installation date, and replacement schedule",
    "Maintain food defense logs documenting visitor access, employee badge issuance, security incidents, vulnerability assessments, and corrective action implementation",

    "Improper chemical storage or use can result in direct contamination of food products with toxic substances leading to serious public health consequences and product recalls",
    "Non-food grade chemicals used inappropriately on food contact surfaces can leave residues that harbor pathogenic bacteria including Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and E. coli",
    "GMP signage serves as a critical reminder system to prevent behavioral contamination vectors such as improper handwashing which can transfer pathogens from workers to products",
    "Food defense controls prevent intentional adulteration with biological, chemical, or physical contaminants that could cause widespread illness or death in the consuming population",
    "Chemical cross-contamination between food grade and non-food grade products can introduce antimicrobial-resistant bacteria or chemical residues that compromise food safety",
    "Proper chemical segregation prevents accidental use of toxic substances in food production areas where they could come into contact with products, ingredients, or food contact surfaces",
    "Food defense vulnerabilities create opportunities for intentional introduction of pathogens or toxins by disgruntled employees, terrorists, or other malicious actors",
    "Effective GMP implementation supported by visible signage reduces the likelihood of cross-contamination events that can introduce allergens, pathogens, or foreign materials into finished products"
